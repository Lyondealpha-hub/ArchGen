# ArchGen
Project Structure Generator for web and mobile development 


ArchGen is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of setting up new software projects with well-defined architectural patterns and organized project structures. It provides developers with an automated and customizable approach to generate the initial project layout, tailored to specific frameworks.


Usage:
Developers can start using ArchGen by specifying their preferred architectural pattern, programming language, and desired framework. Additionally, they can customize templates or use the pre-defined templates available with the tool. Once the configuration is set, ArchGen will create the project structure accordingly.

With ArchGen, developers can focus on building their applications while adhering to a well-organized and maintainable project structure. The generated architecture sets the foundation for scalable, robust, and maintainable software projects.

Note: **ArchGen is an open-source project, actively maintained by Bytewave Inc. Contributions and feedback are welcomed to improve the tool and expand its capabilities further**.
